			</hgroup>
			<p>It was Albert’s uncle who thought of our trying a newspaper. He said he thought we should not find the bandit business a paying industry, as a permanency, and that journalism might be.</p>
			<p>We had sold Noël’s poetry and that piece of information about Lord Tottenham to the good editor, so we thought it would not be a bad idea to have a newspaper of our own. We saw plainly that editors must be very rich and powerful, because of the grand office and the man in the glass case, like a museum, and the soft carpets and big writing-table. Besides our having seen a whole handful of money that the editor pulled out quite carelessly from his trousers pocket when he gave me my five bob.</p>
			<p>Dora wanted to be editor and so did Oswald, but he gave way to her because she is a girl, and afterwards he knew that it is true what it says in the copybooks about Virtue being its own Reward. Because you’ve no idea what a bother it is. Everybody wanted to put in everything just as they liked, no matter how much room there was on the page. It was simply awful! Dora put up with it as long as she could and then she said if she wasn’t let alone she wouldn’t go on being editor; they could be the paper’s editors themselves, so there.</p>
			<p>Then Oswald said, like a good brother: “I will help you if you like, Dora,” and she said, “You’re more trouble than all the rest of them! Come and be editor and see how you like it. I give it up to you.” But she didn’t, and we did it together. We let Albert-next-door be subeditor, because he had hurt his foot with a nail in his boot that gathered.</p>
			<p>When it was done Albert-next-door’s uncle had it copied for us in typewriting, and we sent copies to all our friends, and then of course there was no one left that we could ask to buy it. We did not think of that until too late. We called the paper the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Lewisham Recorder</i>; Lewisham because we live there, and Recorder in memory of the good editor. I could write a better paper on my head, but an editor is not allowed to write all the paper. It is very hard, but he is not. You just have to fill up with what you can get from other writers. If I ever have time I will write a paper all by myself. It won’t be patchy. We had no time to make it an illustrated paper, but I drew the ship going down with all hands for the first copy. But the typewriter can’t draw ships, so it was left out in the other copies. The time the first paper took to write out no one would believe! This was the Newspaper:⁠—</p>

						<p>Editorial Note</p>

					<p>Every paper is written for some reason. Ours is because we want to sell it and get money. If what we have written brings happiness to any sad heart we shall not have laboured in vain. But we want the money too. Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness, but we are not like that, and it is best not to be deceitful.⁠—<b epub:type="z3998:signature">Editors.</b></p>
					<p>There will be two serial stories; one by Dicky and one by all of us. In a serial story you only put in one chapter at a time. But we shall put all our serial story at once, if Dora has time to copy it. Dicky’s will come later on.</p>

						<p>The sun was setting behind a romantic-looking tower when two strangers might have been observed descending the crest of the hill. The eldest, a man in the prime of life; the other a handsome youth who reminded everybody of Quentin Durward. They approached the Castle, in which the fair Lady Alicia awaited her deliverers. She leaned from the castellated window and waved her lily hand as they approached. They returned her signal, and retired to seek rest and refreshment at a neighbouring hostelry.</p>

						<p>The Princess was very uncomfortable in the tower, because her fairy godmother had told her all sorts of horrid things would happen if she didn’t catch a mouse every day, and she had caught so many mice that now there were hardly any left to catch. So she sent her carrier pigeon to ask the noble Strangers if they could send her a few mice⁠—because she would be of age in a few days and then it wouldn’t matter. So the fairy godmother⁠—(I’m very sorry, but there’s no room to make the chapters any longer.⁠—<b><abbr epub:type="z3998:signature">Ed.</abbr></b>)</p>

						<p>I must now retrace my steps and tell you something about our hero. You must know he had been to an awfully jolly school, where they had turkey and goose every day for dinner, and never any mutton, and as many helps of pudding as a fellow cared to send up his plate for⁠—so of course they had all grown up very strong, and before he left school he challenged the Head to have it out man to man, and he gave it him, I tell you. That was the education that made him able to fight Red Indians, and to be the stranger who might have been observed in the first chapter.</p>

						<p>And so when the dragon was dead there were lots of mice, because he used to kill them for his tea; but now they rapidly multiplied and ravaged the country, so the fair lady Alicia, sometimes called the Princess, had to say she would not marry anyone unless they could rid the country of this plague of mice. Then the Prince, whose real name didn’t begin with <i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">N</i>, but was Osrawalddo, waved his magic sword, and the dragon stood before them, bowing gracefully. They made him promise to be good, and then they forgave him; and when the wedding breakfast came, all the bones were saved for him. And so they were married and lived happy ever after.</p>

						<p>Sam Redfern, or the Bushranger’s Burial</p>

						<p>“Well, Annie, I have bad news for you,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ridgway, as he entered the comfortable dining-room of his cabin in the Bush. “Sam Redfern the Bushranger is about this part of the Bush just now. I hope he will not attack us with his gang.”</p>
						<p>“I hope not,” responded Annie, a gentle maiden of some sixteen summers.</p>
						<p>Just then came a knock at the door of the hut, and a gruff voice asked them to open the door.</p>
						<p>“It is Sam Redfern the Bushranger, father,” said the girl.</p>
						<p>“The same,” responded the voice, and the next moment the hall door was smashed in, and Sam Redfern sprang in, followed by his gang.</p>

						<p>Annie’s Father was at once overpowered, and Annie herself lay bound with cords on the drawing-room sofa. Sam Redfern set a guard round the lonely hut, and all human aid was despaired of. But you never know. Far away in the Bush a different scene was being enacted.</p>
						<p>“Must be Injuns,” said a tall man to himself as he pushed his way through the brushwood. It was Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective. “I know them,” he added; “they are Apaches.” Just then ten Indians in full war-paint appeared. Carlton raised his rifle and fired, and slinging their scalps on his arm he hastened towards the humble log hut where resided his affianced bride, Annie Ridgway, sometimes known as the Flower of the Bush.</p>

						<p>They had rifled the cellars of the hut, and the rich wines flowed like water in the golden goblets of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ridgway.</p>
						<p>But Annie had made friends with one of the gang, a noble, good-hearted man who had joined Sam Redfern by mistake, and she had told him to go and get the police as quickly as possible.</p>
						<p>“Ha! ha!” cried Redfern, “now I am enjoying myself!” He little knew that his doom was near upon him.</p>
						<p>Just then Annie gave a piercing scream, and Sam Redfern got up, seizing his revolver.</p>
						<p>“Who are you?” he cried, as a man entered.</p>
						<p>“I am Jim Carlton, the celebrated detective,” said the new arrival.</p>
						<p>Sam Redfern’s revolver dropped from his nerveless fingers, but the next moment he had sprung upon the detective with the well-known activity of the mountain sheep, and Annie shrieked, for she had grown to love the rough Bushranger.</p>

					<p>It is useless to plant cherrystones in the hope of eating the fruit, because they don’t!</p>

						<p>Seeds and Bulbs</p>
					</header>
					<p>These are useful to play at shop with, until you are ready. Not at dinner-parties, for they will not grow unless uncooked. Potatoes are not grown with seed, but with chopped-up potatoes. Apple trees are grown from twigs, which is less wasteful.</p>
					<p>Oak trees come from acorns. Everyone knows this. When Noël says he could grow one from a peach stone wrapped up in oak leaves, he shows that he knows nothing about gardening but marigolds, and when I passed by his garden I thought they seemed just like weeds now the flowers have been picked.</p>
					<p>A boy once dared me to eat a bulb.</p>
					<p>Dogs are very industrious and fond of gardening. Pincher is always planting bones, but they never grow up. There couldn’t be a bone tree. I think this is what makes him bark so unhappily at night. He has never tried planting dog-biscuit, but he is fonder of bones, and perhaps he wants to be quite sure about them first.</p>
